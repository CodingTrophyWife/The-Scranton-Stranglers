## Description:

Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Shout Outs:

First and foremost Id like to thank The Office for even existing! 

Second, My Hubby as always for being so patient with me during this learning time! 


## Installation:

I wanna say to just put npm install in your terminal because that seems like a recurring thing in these last assignments.


## Usage:

To use just type in npm index.js and you will be prompted with questions. You can add a Manager, Engineer or Intern. Once you are all done click on finished and your index.html will be created and you can open that file in the browser and you will see your whole team!
